        Over the last century, the Earth's temperature has increased by approximately 1 degree Celsius, 
        leading to significant changes in weather patterns and sea levels. This warming trend has accelerated 
        in recent decades, attributed largely to increased emissions of greenhouse gases by human activities. 
        As a result, polar ice caps are melting at an unprecedented rate, sea levels are rising, and weather 
        patterns are becoming more extreme. The need for immediate and significant action to reduce carbon emissions 
        and mitigate climate change effects is more urgent than ever."""
